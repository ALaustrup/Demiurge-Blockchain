# THE LAWS OF THE DEMIURGE-BLOCKCHAIN
- SERVER: Always refer to the physical server as 'Monad' and hostname as 'Pleroma'.
- IDENTITY: 'Qor ID' is the singular, non-dual identity system for all users.
- CURRENCY: 'Creator God Token' (CGT). Precision: 8 decimals. Supply: 1,000,000,000.
- TOOLS: 'Qor Installer' (Setup) and 'Qor Launcher' (The Hub).
- NAMING: Use Gnostic conventions (Aeons, Archons, Syzygies) for internal logic. Ask for confirmation before naming new modules.
- HARDWARE: All high-entropy operations (Substrate/UE5) must use /data (RAID 0).
