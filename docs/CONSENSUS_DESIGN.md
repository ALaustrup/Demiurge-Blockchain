# 🎯 Consensus Design - Hybrid PoS + BFT

**Fast finality for creators, developers, and gamers**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Hybrid Approach

**PoS (Proof of Stake)** for block production:
- Validators selected based on stake
- Weighted random selection
- Energy efficient
- Governance integrated

**BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** for finality:
- 2/3+ validator agreement
- Fast finality (< 2 seconds)
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Irreversible blocks

---

## ⚡ Performance Targets

- **Block Time**: < 1 second
- **Finality**: < 2 seconds
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ TPS
- **Latency**: < 100ms

## 🔐 Security Model

### Validator Selection
- Minimum stake requirement
- Governance approval
- Reputation system
- Slashing for misbehavior

### Finality Guarantees
- 2/3+ Byzantine fault tolerance
- Irreversible after finality
- Fast confirmation
- Safe for high-value transactions

## 💰 Staking Mechanism

### For Validators
- Stake CGT to become validator
- Earn block rewards
- Commission on nominations
- Slashing risk

### For Nominators
- Nominate validators
- Share in rewards
- Lower risk than validating
- Easy participation

## 🎮 Gaming Optimization

### Fast Finality
- Sub-second blocks
- Instant confirmation
- No waiting for games
- Smooth gameplay

### Low Latency
- < 100ms query time
- Real-time updates
- Responsive UX
- No lag
