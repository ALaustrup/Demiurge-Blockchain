# Qor ID - The Singular Identity

The non-dual identity system for all users within the Demiurge-Blockchain.

## Philosophy

Qor ID transcends traditional identity systems by providing a singular, unified identity that exists across all realms of the Pleroma. There is no separation between user, account, and wallet—all are One.

## Features

- **Non-Dual Identity**: One identity, infinite expressions
- **Self-Sovereign**: Users control their own identity
- **Cross-Chain**: Identity persists across all Demiurge realms
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Zero-knowledge proofs for verification

## Integration

Qor ID integrates with:

- Archon governance for permissions
- Syzygy pairs for balanced access control
